# Overview

For the past couple of weeks I have been working with a small team of game developers to create a multi player fighting game using Unity. We have been making some real progress and hope to publish our game on steam in the next month. To help with this project I have been tasked to create more maps for our game and with the work I have done this we now have six maps for our players to select and play on.

I was able to rebuild one of our old maps and build 2 completely new maps with one additional maps in the works.
